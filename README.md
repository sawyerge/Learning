Start Learning using Python on Data Science

As an old guy ragarding to software develop industry, I decided to start leanring software development again or maybe the fifth try.

My target is to use Python for data science / data analysis. Reason is from years ago (probably 12 years ago), I was in charge of a monitoring project which generated Gb level data. I was very interested to understand and figure out something interested inside. Due to some reasons, what I could do is to review these data one by one and analysis in my brain. Not good.

5 years ago, I moved to Canada and joined my current company. I found that I can access another big data again. Someone else did some research and released some results. At that time, Big Data wasn't such popular as now. I thought this might be a great future or good opportunity.

Again, I didn't make it as I was trying to move from a pure engineer to a people cross the techniques and business.

Now, I think I should try again to refresh my memory of software engineer and jump into the data science which until now looks fun.

Yes, after my kids go to beds and my wife finshes her staring of the IPhone, it is one of the several limited things I am still willing to do to pass the midnight.

Let me start and see.

Everything I will start from the very beginning.
